# JLox

This is my own version of the Lox language from the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).
I'm adding more features than the book does for fun, but still trying to keep the essence of the language.

## The language
the same as js but with `fun` instead of `function` and `nil` instead of `null`
